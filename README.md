## ⚡ Getting Started  

### Backend Setup  
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `backend/` directory:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dinushasandamali/Hand-Drawn-Circuit-Component-Detection-and-Classification.git  
   cd circuit-component-detection/backend  
   ```  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
4. Add your trained YOLOv8 model as `best.pt`.  
5. Launch the server:  
   ```bash
   python app.py  
   ```  

### Frontend Setup  
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
